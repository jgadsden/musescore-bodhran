# musescore-bodhran
An extra instrument file for adding the Bodhrán to Musescore, it needs to be added as an 
instrument extension using the MuseScore menu. Below are the instructions for Mac and Linux:

MuseScore-2
1. copy file `musescore-2/instruments.xml` to `Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/instruments.xml`
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: `MuseScore -> Preferences... -> Score` tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to `Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/instruments.xml` and apply to 'Instrument List 2'
5. MuseScore wil now list the Bodhrán under 'World Music' 'Percussion - Unpitched'

MuseScore-3
1. copy file `musescore-3/instruments.xml` to `Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/instruments.xml`
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: `MuseScore -> Preferences... -> Score` tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to `Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/instruments.xml` and apply to 'Instrument List 2'
5. MuseScore wil now list the Bodhrán under 'World Music' 'Percussion - Unpitched'

Once a Bodhrán instrument staff is added to the score, then there is no need to keep this
instrument file in the 'Instrument List 2' extension.

In the examples directory there is an example score showing both Bodhrán and Tin Whistle staves.
